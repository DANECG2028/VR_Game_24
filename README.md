Date: May 13, 2024
Features Added/Updated Since Last Update
- Created entirely new scene
- Added a laser gun and a few interactables
- Tested game events with interactables
- Added game objects and decorative objects

Issues Encountered
- The laser gun is supposed to make one of the intractables turn into smaller pieces of itself to simulate the item breaking from the gun, but the item is just falling from the world instead, might not fix and just scrap as it is not important to my gameplay concepts.

Lessons Learned
- It is now easier for me to set up a VR game project scene in Unity with all the necessary default settings and steps required. I can do it more efficiently now.

Features Added/Updated Since Last Update
- Added a working door to the game environment
- Added a working button that triggers an in game door
- Fixed bug from last update with breakable interactable object
- Interactable object now works properly when interacted with by the ray gun
- Added basic VR locomotion and teleportation movement
- Player can now explore the entire ship via default controller movement or teleportation
- Added a working wheel and lever

Issues Encountered
- I found that testing the game using Quest Link is getting too laggy, it may be because I have not optimized the game and my computer's age is showing.

Lessons Learned
- The reason the breakable interactable was not working properly was that all the meshes of the smaller objects were enabled and that was messing with the the big parent object.
- Learned that making the ship fly might not be possible due to gameplay issues/limitations. Will continue to research.
