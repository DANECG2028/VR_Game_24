Date: May 13, 2024
Features Added/Updated Since Last Update
- Created entirely new scene
- Added a laser gun and a few interactables
- Tested game events with interactables
- Added game objects and decorative objects

Issues Encountered
- The laser gun is supposed to make one of the intractables turn into smaller pieces of itself to simulate the item breaking from the gun, but the item is just falling from the world instead, might not fix and just scrap as it is not important to my gameplay concepts.

Lessons Learned
- It is now easier for me to set up a VR game project scene in Unity with all the necessary default settings and steps required. I can do it more efficiently now.
